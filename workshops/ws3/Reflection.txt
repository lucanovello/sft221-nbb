To test if the function had blank lines I used a combination of strategies including using mock input data as well as using functions in the ctype library as well as other c libraries. To test that the correct prompts were produced by the program, I would try to simulate user interactions and capture the outputs for verification. I could then compare the programs output, and verify that all of the information has prompted correctly for each type of user input.
